# raw_images
Simple library for working with pixel data in raw buffers. No dependencies except std and OS.

## Guiding principles for this repo
 - No external dependecies
 - As few new types/classes as possible.
 - Free standing functions are preferred.
 - Every module should be as losely coupled as possible. This can lead to some repetition of code but this will be tolerated within reason.

## What is it for
 - Mostly recreation
